# SpeedyNote macOS Build


### Preparation

- Macintosh (macOS 14+), ARM64 or x86-64. Brew no longer supports macOS 13. 

---

### Environment

##### Qt Online Installer

Install with default settings.

Install these packages:

```zsh
brew install qt@6 mupdf librsvg

```
### Build

Run `compile-mac.sh`to build SpeedyNote. The complete build is in `build`. Option 3 for building the .app script may not work, so the user still needs to `brew install qt@6` to make the app run. The generated `dmg` contains an script to let new users set up the dependencies.

## Unknown issues

~~This build document may not reflect the building process of SpeedyNote on an arm64-based Mac. The dmg file offered on GitHub is x86-64 only, so it may not work on arm-based machines. For Apple Silicon Mac users, I highly recommend you compile an arm64 native binary, and the steps should be similar if not identical.~~ SpeedyNote is confirmed to be able to build correctly on arm64 Macs.
